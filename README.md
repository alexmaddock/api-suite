# API Test Suite

The purpose of this is to create an API test suite as a model and see how it performs using a framwork and whatever other issues I may run into. Let the games bening!!

## Toolset Considerations

Chai has a http thing to use whatever you want to call it. Not sure how it compares to using something like Mocha or Jest and then importion some http client like Axios or Isomorphic fetch. 

Need to research other tools on the market as well. But for the moment I think the best will be to use a test framework with the standard Describe-It test runners, something like a http client to import and then a standard assertion library like Chai or something with assert().something() or whatever.

This [here](https://openbase.com/categories/js/best-nodejs-assertion-libraries) mentions the 10 best assertion libs which is nonsense, these are test frameworks with their relevant assertion libs. Maybe it's a reference point to explore... let's see.
